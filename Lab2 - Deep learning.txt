1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?
• More hidden nodes allow the network to learn more complex patterns in the data. 
• But as the number of hidden nodes increases, the network might start to overfit the 
training data, especially if the dataset is small.
• The accuracy is increasing but some points up and downs are there but overall the 
accuracy is increasing with the increase of no. of nodes.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

	• When the network has too few hidden nodes, it might be underfitting the data, 
	meaning it can't capture the underlying patterns in the training set. Both training and 
	test accuracy are low.

	• As the number of hidden nodes increases, the model starts to fit the training data 

	better. The training accuracy increases, and if the number of nodes is just right, the 

	test accuracy will also improve.

	• Eventually, adding more nodes doesn't significantly change the performance. The 

	test accuracy plateaus or might even slightly degrade, while the training accuracy 

	remains high
